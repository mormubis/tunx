# AGENTS.md

Agent guidance for the `@echecs/tunx` package — SwissManager TUNX binary
tournament file parser/serializer.

See the root `AGENTS.md` for workspace-wide conventions (package manager,
TypeScript settings, formatting, naming, testing, ESLint rules).

**Backlog:** tracked in
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/echecsjs/tunx/issues).

## Project Overview

Binary parser and serializer for SwissManager `.TUNX` files. Zero runtime
dependencies. Named exports:

- `parse(input, options?) → Tournament | undefined` — decodes a TUNX binary.
  Never throws; failures return `undefined` and call `options.onError`.
  Recoverable issues (e.g. missing players, empty strings) call
  `options.onWarning`.
- `stringify(tournament) → Uint8Array` — re-encodes a parsed tournament.
  Requires `tournament._raw` and throws `RangeError` if it is absent.
- `create(template, input) → Tournament` — constructs a new `Tournament` from a
  template TUNX file and a plain-object description.

Output types align with the `@echecs/trf` model:

- `Tournament` has flat fields: `chiefArbiter`, `startDate`/`endDate`, `rounds`
  (count), `roundDates[]`, `pairings[][]`, plus the usual name/venue/arbiter
  metadata.
- `Player` has: `name` (combined "Surname, Firstname"), `fideId` (string), `sex`
  (`'m'` | `'w'`), `points`, `rank`, `results: RoundResult[]`.
- Results use `ResultCode` (`'1'`, `'0'`, `'='`, `'+'`, `'-'`, etc.) matching
  TRF conventions.

Full round-trip fidelity is the primary design constraint — parsing a file and
re-serializing it must produce byte-for-byte identical output to the original.

## TUNX Format Reference

SwissManager TUNX is a proprietary binary format produced by the SwissManager
pairing software. All integers are little-endian.

### Header (bytes 0x00–0x6B, 108 bytes)

Fixed-size block at the start of every file. Starts with the 4-byte magic
`93 FF 89 44` (LE: `0x4489FF93`). The header is preserved verbatim for
round-trip fidelity.

| Offset | Size | Field         | Type  | Notes                                    |
| ------ | ---- | ------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 0x00   | 4    | Magic         | U32LE | `0x4489FF93`                             |
| 0x04   | 4    | (reserved)    | U32LE | Always 0 in known samples                |
| 0x08   | 20   | License hash  | bytes | High-entropy, identical per SW install   |
| 0x1C   | 4    | Saved-at date | U32LE | YYYYMMDD integer                         |
| 0x20   | 4    | Tournament ID | U32LE | Matches chess-results.com tournament IDs |
| 0x24   | 4    | (unknown)     | U32LE | Purpose undetermined                     |
| 0x28   | 8    | (reserved)    | —     | Always 0                                 |
| 0x30   | 4    | Installed-at  | U32LE | YYYYMMDD integer, likely SW install date |
| 0x34   | 52   | Install sig.  | bytes | High-entropy, identical per SW install   |

### Metadata strings (0x6C → config marker)

Sequence of variable-length UTF-16LE strings, each prefixed by a U16LE character
count. Field indices:

| Index | Field            |
| ----- | ---------------- |
| 0     | Tournament name  |
| 1     | Subtitle (short) |
| 2     | Subtitle (long)  |
| 3     | Chief arbiter    |
| 4     | Deputy arbiter   |
| 5     | Venue            |
| 6     | Other arbiters   |
| 7     | PGN path 1       |
| 8     | PGN path 2       |
| 9     | Short name       |
| 10    | City             |
| 11    | Internal ID      |
| 13    | Categories       |
| 14    | Time control     |
| 20    | Federation       |

### Config section (marker `95 FF 89 44`)

Starts with the 4-byte config marker. Relevant offsets within the data (after
skipping the 4-byte marker):

| Offset | Size  | Field          |
| ------ | ----- | -------------- |
| 0x00   | U16LE | Total rounds   |
| 0x11   | U8    | Current round  |
| 0x13   | U16LE | Player count   |
| 0x1B   | U8    | Tiebreak count |
| 0x1C   | 10    | Tiebreak codes |
| 0x47   | U32LE | Start date     |
| 0x4B   | U32LE | End date       |

Tiebreak codes are 5 × U16LE slots at offset 0x1C. Only the high byte of each
U16LE value is meaningful (the low byte is always 0x00). Known codes:

| Code | Tiebreak           |
| ---- | ------------------ |
| 0x0B | Progressive        |
| 0x25 | Performance rating |
| 0x34 | Median Buchholz    |
| 0x3D | Number of wins     |
| 0x44 | Direct encounter   |
| 0x51 | Sonneborn-Berger   |
| 0x54 | Buchholz           |
| 0x55 | Buchholz Cut 1     |
| 0x58 | Average rating     |

The entire config section is stored raw for round-trip.

### Player section (marker `A5 FF 89 44`)

Immediately follows the config section. Each player record contains:

1. **30 UTF-16LE strings** — surname, first name, title, club, federation,
   national ID, etc.
2. **110-byte numeric block** — fixed-size binary data including:

| Offset | Size  | Field              |
| ------ | ----- | ------------------ |
| 0x06   | U8    | Sex (0=M, 1=F)     |
| 0x08   | U16LE | FIDE rating        |
| 0x0A   | U16LE | National rating    |
| 0x0E   | U16LE | Rating delta       |
| 0x10   | U16LE | Rating period      |
| 0x12   | U16LE | Category ID        |
| 0x16   | U16LE | Registration ID    |
| 0x18   | U32LE | FIDE ID            |
| 0x38   | U16LE | Alphabetical index |
| 0x3A   | U16LE | K-factor           |

Player string field indices within the 30-field block:

| Index | Field       |
| ----- | ----------- |
| 0     | Surname     |
| 1     | First name  |
| 3     | Short name  |
| 4     | Title       |
| 5     | National ID |
| 9     | Club        |
| 10    | Federation  |

### Pairings section (marker `B3 FF 89 44`)

Each pairing record is 21 bytes:

| Offset | Size  | Field               |
| ------ | ----- | ------------------- |
| 0      | U16LE | White player number |
| 2      | U16LE | Black player number |
| 4      | U16LE | Result code         |

Result codes: `0` = unpaired, `1` = white wins, `2` = draw, `3` = black wins,
`4` = white wins (forfeit), `5` = black wins (forfeit), `9` = unplayed/bye.

Bye player number is `0xFFFE`. Records are ordered by round then board. Pairings
per round = `ceil(playerCount / 2)`.

The entire pairings section (including marker and all trailing sub-sections such
as `D3` and `E3`) is stored verbatim in `_raw.pairingsSection`.

### D3 section (marker `D3 FF 89 44`)

Section offset table containing 4 × U32LE absolute file offsets pointing to the
A3, A5, B3, and D3 markers respectively. Followed by 12 zero bytes (reserved
slots). Used by SwissManager as a quick-jump index.

### E3 section (marker `E3 FF 89 44`)

File terminator. Always empty (0 bytes of data after the marker). Last 4 bytes
of every TUNX file.

## Common Data Model

`@echecs/tunx` and `@echecs/trf` both produce and consume a `Tournament` type
with compatible structure. The core shared shape:

- `Tournament` — top-level container with `players: Player[]`, `rounds: number`,
  and optional metadata (`name`, `chiefArbiter`, `startDate`, `endDate`, etc.).
- `Player` — structurally identical across both packages: `name`,
  `pairingNumber`, `points`, `rank`, `results: RoundResult[]`, plus optional
  FIDE fields.
- `RoundResult` — `round`, `color`, `opponentId`, `result: ResultCode`.
- `ResultCode` — same union: `'1'`, `'0'`, `'='`, `'+'`, `'-'`, `'W'`, `'D'`,
  `'L'`, etc.

TRF's `Tournament` is a superset (teams, scoring systems, acceleration, byes).
TUNX's `Tournament` adds format-specific fields (`_raw`, `pairings`, `header`).
The types are duplicated, not shared — each package defines its own.

When modifying shared types (`Player`, `RoundResult`, `ResultCode`, or the
common `Tournament` fields), keep both packages in sync. Changes to one must be
reflected in the other so their `parse()` output remains structurally
compatible.

---

## Architecture Notes

- **ESM-only** — the package ships only ESM. Do not add a CJS build.
- No runtime dependencies — keep it that way.
- Types align with the `@echecs/trf` model — `Tournament`, `Player`,
  `RoundResult`, and `ResultCode` follow TRF conventions.
- `parse()` and `stringify()` are synchronous — do not introduce async.
- `src/index.ts` is a re-export barrel. Logic lives in `src/parse.ts` and
  `src/stringify.ts`.
- `src/constants.ts` contains all binary layout constants.
- `src/types.ts` contains all exported types.
- `src/reader.ts` — `BinaryReader` class: cursor-based reader over a
  `Uint8Array` with `readU8()`, `readU16LE()`, `readU32LE()`, `readString()`
  (UTF-16LE), and `readBytes()`.
- `src/writer.ts` — `BinaryWriter` class: chunk-accumulating writer with
  `writeU8()`, `writeU16LE()`, `writeU32LE()`, `writeString()` (UTF-16LE), and
  `writeBytes()`. Call `toUint8Array()` to flush all chunks.
- `Tournament._raw` preserves the original byte sequences needed for round-trip
  reconstruction: `headerBytes`, `metadataStrings`, `configBytes`,
  `playerStrings`, `playerNumericBytes`, `pairingsSection`.
- Section markers are located using a linear byte-scan (`findMarker`) rather
  than fixed offsets; the metadata and config sections have variable length.
- All interface fields sorted alphabetically (`sort-keys` is an ESLint error).
- Always use `.js` extensions on relative imports (NodeNext resolution).

---

## Error Handling

- `parse()` returns `undefined` for unrecoverable failures (bad magic, missing
  section markers) and calls `options.onError`.
- `parse()` calls `options.onWarning` for recoverable issues (player count
  mismatch, unexpected end of data, zero round count).
- `stringify()` throws `RangeError` if `tournament._raw` is absent.
- Never use `null`; prefer `undefined` for absent optional values.

## Release Protocol

Step-by-step process for releasing a new version. CI auto-publishes to npm when
`version` in `package.json` changes on `main`.

1. **Verify the package is clean:**

   ```bash
   pnpm lint && pnpm test && pnpm build
   ```

   Do not proceed if any step fails.

2. **Decide the semver level:**
   - `patch` — bug fixes, internal refactors with no API change
   - `minor` — new features, new exports, non-breaking additions
   - `major` — breaking changes to the public API

3. **Update `CHANGELOG.md`** following
   [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com) format:

   ```markdown
   ## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD

   ### Added

   - …

   ### Changed

   - …

   ### Fixed

   - …

   ### Removed

   - …
   ```

   Include only sections that apply. Use past tense.

4. **Update `README.md`** if the release introduces new public API, changes
   usage examples, or deprecates/removes existing features.

5. **Bump the version:**

   ```bash
   npm version <major|minor|patch> --no-git-tag-version
   ```

6. **Open a release PR:**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b release/x.y.z
   git add package.json CHANGELOG.md README.md
   git commit -m "release: @echecs/tunx@x.y.z"
   git push -u origin release/x.y.z
   gh pr create --title "release: @echecs/tunx@x.y.z" --body "<description>"
   ```

   Wait for CI (format, lint, test) to pass on the PR before merging.

7. **Merge the PR:** Once CI is green, merge (squash) into `main`. The release
   workflow detects the version bump, publishes to npm, and creates a GitHub
   Release with a git tag.

Do not manually publish with `npm publish`. Do not create git tags manually —
the release workflow handles tagging.
